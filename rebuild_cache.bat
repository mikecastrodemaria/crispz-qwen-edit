rem Pre-fills the dequantisation cache of the single-file FP8/INT8 checkpoints, so

rem Re-runnable at will: whatever is already cached is skipped in a second.
rem Options: rebuild_cache.bat --list           (shows without converting)
rem          rebuild_cache.bat --cpu            (dequantises without touching the GPU)
rem          rebuild_cache.bat --only jibMix    (a single model, filtered on the name; repeatable)
